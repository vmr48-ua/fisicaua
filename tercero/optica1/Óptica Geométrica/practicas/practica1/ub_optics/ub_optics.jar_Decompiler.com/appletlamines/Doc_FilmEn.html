<h1 class="h1joc">Thin-film layer</h1>


<p>This applet allows the study of the factors that take part in an experiment 
with a thin-film layer. The experiment consists of two possible configurations. 
In the first one light with a given wavelength &#955; comes onto a sample
consisting of a glass substrate with a thin-film coating on top of it. On a second 
configuration, the sample consists of a thin-film layer surrounded by air. The 
applet allows to study the influence of the thickness, the refractive index and the 
extinction coefficient of the film on the reflectance and transmittance properties 
of the sample. Furthermore, it permits visualizing this influence with respect to 
the wavelength through a graphical representation (spectrum).
</p>

<p >
Finally, the applet has the possibility of carrying out a virtual experiment where, 
from a measured spectrum, the values of thickness and refractive index of the thin-film 
layer can be deduced.</p> 


<p>The most important elements that can be calculated by the program are the 
Transmittance (T(&#955;)) and Reflectance (R(&#955;)) spectra 
of the sample. To calculate these values from the refractive index n 
and extinction coefficient k and the thickness of the thin film d 
it is necessary to consider the model in figure 1.

Figure 1: Sketch of the multiple reflections inside a thin-film layer.
</p>

<p>
Let us consider a plane wave incident from the medium (refractive index 1) onto a
thin-film layer with an angle &#949; and with amplitude E<sub>0</sub>.
The aplitude of the transmitted wave into the film can be expressed as 
E<sub>0</sub>t<sub>1</sub>, where t<sub>1</sub> can be the Fresnel 
coefficient for each of the two possible polarizations 's’ or ‘p’.
This plane wave propagates inside the thin-film with an angle &#949;’ and
undergoes multiple reflections. The amplitude after the first reflection on the 
film-substrate interface is  E<sub>0</sub>t<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub> 
where r<sub>2</sub> is the Fresnel reflection coefficient from the film 
to the substrate. At this point, part of the wave is also transmitted with amplitude
E<sub>0</sub>t<sub>1</sub>t<sub>2</sub> where t<sub>2</sub> is the
Fresnel transmission coefficient from the film to the substrate.
After the second reflection inside the film, the amplitude of the reflected wave is 
E<sub>0</sub>t<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>r<sub>1</sub> where r<sub>1</sub> 
is the Fresnel reflection coefficient from the film to the incident medium. This 
wave is then transmitted to the substrate with amplitude
E<sub>0</sub>t<sub>1</sub>r<sub>2</sub>r<sub>1</sub>t<sub>2</sub>.
Thus, the amplitude of the m-th transmitted wave onto the substrate is:

Figure 2: Sketch for the calculation of the optical path difference between two
consecutive transmitted waves. 
</p>

<p>
The next step consists of analyzing the relative phase of each of the transmitted waves.
To perform the calculation it is necessary to take two reference points in two 
consecutive transmitted waves and the these two points are placed on the same plane 
perpendicular to the propagation direction of the waves, as indicated in figure 2.  
It can be shown that the optical path difference between two consecutive transmitted 
waves is:</p>


<p  align=center><img 
src="formules/Lamines_Eq2.gif" >,</p>

<p >The phase corresponding to this optical path is:</p>
<p  align=center><img src="formules/Lamines_Eq3.gif"></p> 
<p>Thus, the complex amplitude of the m-th transmitted wave can be expressed as:</p>

<p  align=center ><img 
src="formules/Lamines_Eq4.gif">.</p>

<p >
Note that in the previous expression, the modulus and phase of the Fresnel 
refelction coefficients 
r<sub>1</sub> i r<sub>2</sub> have been written separately.
The pahses arg(r<sub>1</sub>) and
arg(r<sub>2</sub>) can be different from 0 in those cases when 
the refractive index of the substrate is greater than the refractive index of the 
film (arg(r<sub>2</sub>)=&#960;) or when the extinction coefficient of the 
film is not zero (k&#8800;0, arg(r<sub>1</sub>)&#8800;0 and
arg(r<sub>2</sub>)&#8800;0).</p> 


<p >
The total resulting amplitude is the sum of the complex amplitudes of  all the 
transmitted waves:
</p>

<p  align=center ><img 
src="formules/Lamines_Eq5.gif" >.</p>

<p >
The resulting transmitted intensity is proportional to the square modulus of the 
total transmitted complex amplitude:
</p>

<p  align=center ><img
src="formules/Lamines_Eq6.gif">,</p>

<p >
where the relation cos(&#966;)=2cos<sup>2</sup>(&#966;/2)-1 has been applied.
Analyzing the previous expression, the conditions a maximum or minimum of transmitted light 
can be deduced. For instance, for a dielectric film (with k=0) these conditons
can be summarized on the following table: 
</p>

<p >
Concerning the reflectance, its behavior is the opposite to the transmittance: 
where the former is maximum the latter is minimum and vice-versa. In the case when the film 
is slightly absorbing (extinction coefficient different from 0)  the conditions 
for having a maximum or a minimum in the transmittance are more complex since they 
have to take into account the phase &#948;.</p>

<p >
The final Reflectance and Transmittance of the sample depend as well on the 
Reflectance and Transmittance of the second face of the substrate. Since the 
latter do not depend on the characteristics of the film, this second face does 
not affect the distribution of R and T maxima and minima. 
</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Window “Transmission and Reflection”</h2>

<p >
This window shows a sketch of the sample with the substrate in blue and the film
on its top in yellow. Incident light is represented by a set of beams in green 
while light reflected is represented in a set of magenta beams. Transmitted light
is represented in cyan. The sketch of the sample includes also the values of 
transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) of the sample. It is worth 
noting that the light is assumed to be monochromatic and with natural polarization
(a uniform superposition of all possible polarization states).</p>

<p >
The window "Transmission and Reflection" allows changing the thickness of the layer
(d), the wavelength of the incident light (&#955;),  and the angle 
of incidence (&#952;). Furthermore, the values of the refractive index 
(n) and extinctionc coefficient (k) can be changed by means of the 
buttons "<b>Change n</b>" and "<b>Change k</b>". These buttons open two windows 
with the names "Refractive index parameters" and "Extinction coefficient 
parameters" respectively. These parameters correspond to a mathematical model 
for the refractive index and the extinction coefficient that follows the expression:
</p>

<p  align=center ><img 
src="formules/Lamines_Eq7.gif"></p>

<p >
These windows allow changing the values of A, B, C, 
k<sub>0</sub> and D and show a plot of these indexes against the
wavelength.
</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Window "Phase Difference"</h2>

<p >
This window shows a diagram of the path followed by a beam inside the thin film. 
For the selected wavelength it shows the value of the refractive index and of the 
extinction coefficient of the film (n_l and k_l on the diagram), as well as the
refractive index of the substrate. The window allows changing the thickness of the 
film (d), the wavelength (&#955;) the angle of incidence (&#949;).
In addition, the values of the refractive index and of the extinction coefficient
can be changed with the buttons "<b>Change n</b>" and "<b>Change k</b>".
</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Window "Spectrum"</h2>

<p >
This window shows the Reflectance and Transmittance spectra for the sample with 
the current configuration. It has to be kept in mind that these values are the
result of the transmission and reflection on the film and also on the second
face of the substrate. By placing the cursor on the plot, the values corresponding 
to the position with respect to the coordinate axes on the graph can be read on 
the lower part of the window. 
The button &quot;<b>Configure Plot</b>&quot; allows defining the way the plot is presented. 
The lower and upper limits of the wavelength represented on the plot can be defined
as well as the lower and upper limits of the reflectance and transmittance 
represented on the plot. These last two values can be assigned automatically with 
the buttons on the lower part of the window. Thus, the button "<b>R/T Range 0/1</b>"
assigns the value 0 to the "Initial T and R value" and 1 to the "Final T and R value".
The button "<b>Auto Range</b>" assigns automatically the minimum R/T range
that permits representing simultaneously the two spectra. The buttons "<b>Auto Range R</b>"
and "<b>Auto Range T</b>" assign automatically the minimum R/T range that
permits representing the spectra of R or T respectively.
</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Window "T Maxima and  Minima"</h2>

<p >
This window shows a list of the Transmittance maxima and minima that can be seen 
in the spectrum plot. The option "<b>Variable: Wavelength</b>" lists the maxima
and minima as a function of the wavelength. This list is caluclated for the values of 
n(&#955;), k(&#955;) and thickness of the film and for
the selected angle of incidence.
The option "<b>Variable: Angle</b>&quot; the list is calculated as a function of the 
angle of incidence for the wavelength selected on the left window.
</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">The virtual experiment: the button "Experiment"</h2>

<p>
The button "<b>Experiment</b>" simulates an experimental situation where a sample
composed of a substrate with a transparent (k=0) thin-film coating on top of it. 
The thickness and refractive index of the thin-film are unknown and they have to 
be deduced from the analysis of a spectrum taken witn a spectrometer. The window
"<b>Spectrum</b>" shows two spectra (in blue and in yellow, R exp and 
T exp) that correspond to the unknown sample and two spectra corresponding
to the model with the current selected values. The virtual experiment consists of
finding out the values of thickness d and of the variables A and B
which characterize the spectral behavior of the refractive index. To change the
values of A and B the button "<b>Change n</b>" should be used.      
The procedure to find the correct values is that of trial and error: 1) try to change 
the value of one of these parameters, 2) check whether the theoretical spectra fit 
better or not the experimental ones and 3) decide if the change in the parameter is in
the right sense or not.
