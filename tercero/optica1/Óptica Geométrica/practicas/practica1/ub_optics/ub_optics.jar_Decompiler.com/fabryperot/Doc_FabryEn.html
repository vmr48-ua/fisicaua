<h1 class="h1joc">Fabry-Pérot Interferometer</h1>

<p>This applet permits to study the factors that take part in an experiment with
a Fabry-Pérot interferometer. It can be used to visualize the result of the
multiple-wave interferences produced in such an interferometer for an extended
source. The experiment is performed for two very similar wavelengths so that the resolving
power of the instrument can be studied in different conditions. Furthermore, the influence
of the reflection coefficient of the inner faces of the interferometer on the
visibility of the interference rings and on the resolving power. </p>

<p >The window "Transmission and Reflection" contains a diagram of the virtual experiment.
It consists of an extended source (on the left, in a color related to the selected
wavelength), a collimating lens (L1), the Fabry-Pérot étalon (in cyan and yellow,
 where cyan represents the substrate and yellow the high-reflecting coating on the
 inner faces of the étalon), a second lens to project the interferences (L2) and a screen
 (in white, on the right). The source sends light with two very similar wavelengths,
 which will be designated as the main wavelength (<i>&#955;</i>) and secondary
 wavelength (<i >&#955;+&#916&#955;</i>).</p>


<p >The diagram shows the rays corresponding to a point of the source, although it
should not be forgotten that all the points of the source emit. The lenses L1 and
L2 establish a point-to-point correspondence between the source and the screen.
This can be seen by considering the same optical system as in the diagram but without
the Fabry-Pérot etalon. With lens L1 all the rays coming from a same point of the
source propagate in parallel within the space between L1 and L2 and with an angle
<i>&#949;=&#961;/f<sub>1</sub></i>, where <i>&#961;</i> is the distance from
the point of the source to the optical system axis and <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>
is the focal length L1. This angle is the same inside the Fabry-Pérot etalon, becuase
it is an air etalon.</p>

<p >The light undergoes multiple reflections within the Fabry-Pérot etalon, for each
beam with a given angle <i>&#949;</i> with the optical axis, the optical path
difference of two transmitted rays generated at two consecutive internal reflections
is:
</p>

<p  align=center ><img src="formules/Fabry_Eq1.gif">
.</p>

<p >Where <i >d</i> is the thickness of the etalon and <i >&#955;</i> is the wavelength
of the light. After this, the lens L2 concentrates these rays onto the same point
on the screen, where the corresponding waves interfere. The intensity for a given point
will be maximum when <i>&#916;&#966;=2m</i><i>&#960;</i>, and minimum when
<i >&#916;&#966;=(2m+1)</i> with <i >m =
0, </i><i >±1, </i><i >±2,</i>...</p>


<h2 class="h2joc">Window "Transmission and Reflection"</h2>

<p >This window allows to modify the thickness of the etalon (<i >d</i>), the
reflection coefficient of the inner sides of the interferometer (<i>r</i>), the
main wavelength of the source used in the experiment (<i >&#955;</i>) and the
difference between the secondary and main wavelengths (<i >&#916;&#955;</i>).
The changes can be done by means of the sliders or by entering the desired value
in the edit boxes to the right of the sliders.</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Window "Intensity"</h2>

<p >This window shows a diagram of the intensity (for the selected wavelengths)
as a function of the distance to the optical axis on the screen. This intensity
can be expressed as:</p>

<p  align=center ><img src="formules/Fabry_Eq2.gif" ></p>

<p >The button <b>Focal Lengths and Sizes</b> opens a window that allows changing
the sizes of the source and the screen and the focal distances of the lenses L1
and L2. The combination of these four values defines the maximum angles of the
light rays within the faces of the Fabry-Pérot etalon as well as the maximum radius
at which interferences can be observed on the screen.</p>

<p >The button <b>Image</b> switches between the graphical representation of the
intensity as a function of the radius and the image of the interferences as they
can be seen on the screen.

<h2 class="h2joc">Window "Phase Difference"</h2>

<p >This windows shows a diagram of the interferometer etalon together with the
path of a given ray with angle <i>&#952;</i> within its faces and the multiple
reflections undergone by the ray. It allows to visualize the phase difference (in
units of <i>&#960;</i>) between two consecutive transmitted rays, for the main
and secondary wavelengths.</p>

<p >This window can be used to change the thickness of the etalon, the angle of
incidence of the rays and the main and secondary wavelengths.</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Window "T Maxima and Minima"</h2>

<p >This window shows a list of the maxima and minima that can be seen on the
screen for the main and secondary wavelengths. The maxima and minima can be listed
as a function of the angles of the rays within the etalon or as a function of the
radius of the rings as seen on the screen.</p>
