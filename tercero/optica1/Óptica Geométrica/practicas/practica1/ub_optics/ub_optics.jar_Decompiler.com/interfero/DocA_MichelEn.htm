<h1 class="h1joc">Michelson interferometer</h1>
<p>This applet lets you study the Michelson interferometer and see the evolution 
  of light rings as the parameters of the system are changed. The case of a point 
  source, which corresponds to the Twyman interferometer, is also analyzed.</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Michelson interferometer</h2>
  
<p>The Michelson interferometer consists of an extended source located at the 
  focal plane of a lens (so the emerging rays are parallel), a semireflecting 
  plate that divides the beam into two, and two mirrors. The beams, after reflection 
  at the mirrors, are re-combined at the plate exit and interfere. The interferences 
  are observed at the focal plane of a collimator lens. As the vertical beam traverses 
  the plate three times while the horizontal beam passes through it only once, 
  a compensating plate of the same material and thickness as the semireflecting 
  plate is added in the horizontal arm.</p>
<p>If the two beams that interfere have the same intensity, the resulting intensity 
  will be:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Michel_Ec1.gif"></p>

<p>where <font face=Symbol size=+1>&#955;</font> &nbsp; is 
  the wavelength of light (in the vacuum) and <font face=Symbol size=+1>&#916;</font> &nbsp;
  is the optical path difference between the two light beams, which is due to 
  the different length of the interferometer's arms (d). If we consider a beam 
  that enters and exits the system making an angle <font face=Symbol size=+1>&#952;</font> &nbsp;
  with the axis, it is easy to demonstrate that:</p>
  
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Michel_Ec2.gif"></p>

<p> n is the refraction index of the medium where the interferometer is placed. 
  A constructive or destructive interference will take place whenever this path 
  length difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength or an odd integer 
  multiple of half a wavelength, respectively:</p>  
  
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Michel_Ec3.gif"></p>

<p> From these conditions we can see that all the rays that form the same angle 
  with the axis will be in the same interference state. When observing the interference 
  pattern on the focal plane of a lens of focal length f', rings of radii</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Michel_Ec4.gif"></p>

<p>will appear. We may observe that, as the angle or radii becomes greater, the 
  corresponding order of interference gets smaller. On the other hand, in the 
  center of the image (<font face=Symbol size=+1>&#952;</font>=0), the optical 
  path difference is 2nd, therefore there is only a maximum or minimum of the 
  intensity when this number is an integer multiple of half or one wavelength. 
<p>By modifying the system parameters (wavelength in the vacuum <font face=Symbol size=+1>&#955;</font>, 
  distance d between mirrors, refraction index), you can see the evolution of 
  the interference pattern, which is shown in a color that corresponds to the 
  wavelength. The display area width changes with the lens focal length, as the 
  rings' radii are directly proportional to it. By pressing the &quot;Graphic&quot; 
  button you can see the intensity profile, whereas by pressing the &quot;Image&quot; 
  button you go back to the interference pattern image, which is shown by default 
  at the beginning of the program. We should point out that the separation between 
  maxima gets smaller (rings get closer) as they are further away from the center. 
<p>If the &quot;Diagram&quot; button is pressed, the program shows a diagram to 
  calculate the optical path difference between the two light beams. By pressing 
  the same button, which is now labeled as &quot;Setup&quot;, the Michelson interferometer 
  schema is shown again, as by default. 
<p>This program can be used to measure the wavelength of the light source, by 
  counting the number of bright or dark rings that appear from or disappear into 
  the center of the pattern (<font face=Symbol size=+1>&#952;</font>=0) 
  when the distance between the mirrors is changed between two points that give 
  constructive or destructive interference, respectively. If the number of rings 
  that appear or disappear is N and d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> is the initial 
  and final separation of the mirrors, the wavelength can be calculated as:</p> 
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Michel_Ec5.gif"></p>

<p>While rings appear from the center as the separation of the mirrors is increased, 
  they disappear into it when it is decreased.</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">Twyman interferometer</h2>

<p>The Twyman interferometer has the same arrangement as the Michelson interferometer 
  except that it is illuminated by a point source. Therefore, all beams will be 
  in the same interference state and the interference pattern will have a constant 
  intensity. Its value will depend on the optical path difference 2nd, so a variation 
  by <font face=Symbol size=+1>&#955;</font>/4n of the distance between the mirrors 
  is required to change from a maximum to a minimum intensity value.</p>
