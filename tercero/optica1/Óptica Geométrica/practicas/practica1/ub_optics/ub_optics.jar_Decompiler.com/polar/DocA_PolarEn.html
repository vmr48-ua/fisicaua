<h1 class="h1joc">Light polarization and Fresnel laws</h1>

<p>In this applet we study polarization of light and its reflection and refraction 
  in isotropic media. The first window shows how to achieve the different polarization 
  states of light by superposing two plane waves with special characteristics. 
  The second and third windows show the behavior of reflected and refracted waves 
  depending on the properties of an incident wave on a surface separating two 
  media. The first medium is a dielectric while the second one can be either a 
  dielectric or a conductor. Both the amplitude ratios (Fresnel coefficients) 
  and the polarization ellipse changes are studied.</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">"Polarization" window</h2>

<p>In this window we study the superposition of two plane waves of the same frequency, 
  traveling in the same direction and that have perpendicular electric field 
  directions, different amplitudes and with a phase delay between them.</p>

<p>The amplitudes of the p (A<sub>p</sub>) wave and the s (As) wave and the phase 
  delay &#948;&nbsp;between them can be changed 
  with the sliders. The plot at the bottom represents these two waves. The corresponding 
  electric fields E<sub>p</sub> and E<sub>s</sub> can be expressed as:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec1.gif"> </p>

<p>As the waves propagate, the endpoint of the resultant electric field vector 
  traces an ellipse, which is plotted on the upper left graph. We can also see 
  the characteristics of this polarization ellipse: the semimajor and semiminor 
  axes, and the angle with the p-axis, in degrees. The Stokes vector <b>S</b> 
  describing the polarization state of light is indicated as well. The Stokes 
  parameters are computed in the following way:</p>
  
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec2.gif"> </p>

<p>The sign of the S parameter shows whether light is right-handed (S&gt;0), in 
  other words it turns clockwise, or left-handed (S&lt;0), when it turns counter-clockwise. 
  This is indicated in the black window by the letter R or L, respectively.</p>
  
<h2 class="h2joc">"Dielectrics" window</h2>

<p>In this window we study light reflection and refraction in dielectric isotropic 
  media, taking into account Fresnel equations. These equations specify the values 
  of the electric field vector amplitude when light changes from one medium to 
  another one, or when it is reflected, as a function of the incident amplitude. 
  We suppose that we are working at a frequency (wavelength) range for which the 
  media are non-absorbent.</p>

<p>Let us consider an incident wave on a surface separating two transparent media 
  with indices of refraction n and n'. If the incident angle is &#966;, 
  the wave is reflected with a reflection angle equal to the incident one and 
  is transmitted to the second medium with a refraction angle &#966;' 
  that can be calculated as:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec3.gif"> </p>

<p>The indices of refraction of the two media and the incident angle can be changed 
  with the sliders. The program calculates the refraction angle and plots the 
  incident (red), reflected (green) and refracted (blue) rays making the corresponding 
  angles with the surface normal. It also computes the Fresnel coefficients, which 
  are the ratios of the reflected (A'') or refracted (A') amplitudes to the incident 
  amplitude (A):</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec4.gif"> </p>

<p>The p and s subscripts refer to the field that vibrates parallel (p) or perpendicularly 
  (s) to the plane of incidence. This plane is determined by the incident ray 
  and the surface normal (on the plot it corresponds to the plane of the screen 
  itself). The p component is represented as a vector with different orientations 
  on this plane, while the s component is plotted as a vector pointing towards 
  the inside or outside of the plane of the screen.</p>
  
<p>For normal incidence, the formulae become:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec5.gif"> </p>

<p>When the <b>&quot;Fresnel coefficients&quot;</b> button is pressed (default 
  option active when starting the program) we can see a plot of the Fresnel coefficients 
  variation with the angle of incidence, in different colors. A yellow dot over 
  the graph indicates the selected incident angle. There are some particularly 
  interesting cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li> When the index of the first medium is greater than the index of the second 
    one (n&gt;n') we can have the <b>total internal reflection</b> phenomenon, 
    in which case there is no transmitted light. This occurs for incident angles 
    greater than the critical angle &#966;<sub>l</sub>&nbsp;(incident 
    angle for which &#966;'=&#960;/2):</li>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec6.gif" width="81" height="41"> 
  </p>
  <p>This angle is shown on the plot. In this case, we have:</p>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec7.gif" width="286" height="26"> 
  </p>
  <p>Both reflection coefficients have modulus 1 and there is only a phase delay 
    2(&#946;-&#945;)-&#960; 
    &nbsp;between the two components (the angle &#960;&nbsp; 
    refers to the minus sign in r<sub>p</sub>), with</p>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec8.gif" width="384" height="50"> 
  </p>
  <p>where</p>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec9.gif" width="46" height="41"> 
  </p>
  <li> When the incident angle is equal to the Brewster angle &#966;<sub>B</sub>, 
    r<sub>p</sub>=0 and there is only reflected light on the plane perpendicular 
    to the plane of incidence. The Brewster angle, which is shown on the plot, 
    is computed as:</li>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec10.gif" width="88" height="41"> 
  </p>
</ul>

<p>Pressing the <b>"Polarization"</b> button opens a new window. In it we can 
  see the polarization ellipses for incident, reflected and transmitted light, 
  in the same colors as the corresponding rays. The axes scale is between 0 and 
  1, and if the scale changes values, a new position is indicated. We can also 
  see the characteristics of the incident wave, which are the ones chosen in the 
  "Polarization" window and can be modified by accessing that window.</p>

<p>When <b>total internal reflection</b> occurs, there is no transmitted polarization 
  ellipse (in blue). The values of the angles 2&#945; 
  &nbsp;(angp) and 2&#946;&nbsp;(angs) are also 
  shown, as well as the total phase retardance between the s and p components 
  of the reflected light. This will be the same as the incident light phase retardance 
  plus (angs-angp-&#960;)&nbsp;. We can see how 
  this value changes with the incident angle and the indices, and how by total 
  reflection it is possible to obtain elliptically polarized light from incident 
  linearly polarized light.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can see that when the incident angle equals the Brewster 
  angle, the reflected light is linearly polarized in the normal direction to 
  the incident plane.</p>

<h2 class="h2joc">&quot;Conductors" window</h2>

<p>In this window we study light reflection on isotropic and conducting media. 
  In this case the index of refraction of the second medium is a complex number,</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec11.gif"> </p>

<p>where n' and k (extinction coefficient) are real and positive constants related 
  to the dielectric constant and the conductivity of the medium. In the applet 
  n' can range between 0.1 and 3.5, and k can range between 0 (&quot;dielectrics&quot; 
  case) and 5.</p>

<p>The Fresnel formulae still apply, but with consideration of the complex index 
  of refraction for the second medium. The reflection coefficients, after some 
  calculation, become:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec12.gif"> </p>

<p>where all are real numbers except the index of refraction of the second medium 
  and the product</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec13.gif"> </p>

<p>We have taken into account that Snell's law is still valid:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec14.gif"> </p>

<p>Here &#966;' has a formal meaning with no geometrical interpretation.</p>
  
<p>As the Fresnel coefficients are complex numbers, the reflected waves might 
  suffer phase changes (&#958;<sub>p</sub> and 
  &#958;<sub>s</sub> for the parallel and perpendicular 
  components, respectively), which depend both on the indices of refraction of 
  the two media and on the incident angle. These parameters can be modified with 
  the sliders. The program also shows the total phase retardance between the s 
  and p components for the reflected light, which is the phase delay occasioned 
  by the incident wave plus (&#958;<sub>s</sub>-&#958;<sub>p</sub>). 
  We must point out that when no additional phase delay is introduced in the reflection, 
  the incident and reflected waves rotate in opposite directions (if one is right-handed, 
  the other one is left-handed, and vice versa). This is because when describing 
  the light polarization state of these two waves they are viewed from opposite 
  sides (each wave is viewed from the direction which the wave is approaching).</p>
  
<p>For normal incidence, the formulae for dielectric media in this particular 
  case apply, with the complex index of refraction for the second medium:</p>
  
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec15.gif"> </p>

<p><b>Transmitted wave</b> behavior is more complex. Here we only study the case 
  of <b>normal incidence</b>, for which the transmissivity T, defined as the ratio 
  between the transmitted and incident intensity, becomes:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec16.gif"> </p>

<p>(R is the reflectivity). The transmitted wave can be written as a plane wave 
  propagating in the conducting medium in the z direction (perpendicular to the 
  surface separating the two media) and having a complex index of refraction. 
  Its electric field vector can be described as: </p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec17.gif"> </p>

<p>This corresponds to a plane wave that propagates in a medium of index n' (real) 
  but with an amplitude that decays exponentially with the distance traveled in 
  the medium (z=0 is taken in the boundary surface). This dependency is shown 
  on a plot, as well as the distance traveled by the wave into the conducting 
  medium for which its amplitude decays in a factor 1/e. This is called skin depth 
  (z<sub>p</sub>) and characterizes the medium:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Polar_Ec18.gif"> </p>

<p>&#955;&nbsp;is the wavelength of light and can be modified with 
  a slider.</p>
