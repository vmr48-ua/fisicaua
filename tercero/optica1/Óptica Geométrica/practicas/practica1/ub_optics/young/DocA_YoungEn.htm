<h1 class="h1joc">Young's experiment</h1>

<p>This applet shows Young interferences resulting from the interaction of a certain 
  number of waves. When using a single extended source or two point sources, spatial 
  coherence can be studied as well.</p>
  
<h2 class="h2joc">&quot;Plane wave&quot; window</h2>

<p>In this window you can study Young's interference fringes resulting from the 
  superposition of several point sources. The schema shown on the upper left side 
  shows an incident plane wave on a plane containing N slits separated by distance 
  d, which are normal to the plane of the drawing. Each of these holes gives rise 
  to secondary coherent waves, as indicated by Huygens' theorem. When observing 
  their superposition on a plane that is a distance D from the slits, we can see 
  interference fringes normal to the drawing plane. These fringes are shown on 
  the upper right side of the window.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the case of <b>N=2 (double slit)</b>: if we assume that 
  the amplitude of both waves is equal for any point within the observation plane, 
  the intensity of the fringes is:</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec1.gif"> </p>

<p>where &#955;&nbsp;is the wavelength of light (in the vacuum) and &#916;&nbsp;is 
  the path length difference between the waves coming from the two slits. If we 
  take the approximation</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec2.gif"> </p>

<p>(observation plane far enough away), the path length difference is:</p>
  
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec3.gif"> </p>

<p>where n is the refraction index of the medium where the waves propagate and 
  x is an axis parallel to the line joining them. We should remember that d is 
  the separation between the slits and D is the distance between the plane containing 
  them and the observation plane.</p>
<p>Whenever the path length difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, 
  constructive interference will take place. If n, d and D are fixed, this depends 
  only on the x-coordinate, which explains why interference fringes are observed. 
  The locations of the several maxima are:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec4.gif"> </p>

<p>with M being an integer value. The distance between maxima (fringe spacing) 
  is:</p>
  
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec5.gif"> </p>

<p>Between every two maxima there is a minimum, for which there is destructive 
  interference and the intensity falls to zero. The applet gives the distance 
  between maxima and minima, which is the same in the case of N=2.</p>
<p>You can also change the system parameters and see the evolution of the corresponding 
  interference image, whose color is in accordance with the selected wavelength. 
  By pressing the &quot;Graphic&quot; button, the intensity profile is shown. 
  When pressing the &quot;Image&quot; button, the fringe pattern is shown again. 
  This is by default on a linear scale, which is indicated by the &quot;Linear 
  intensity on&quot; button. After pressing it, the intensity appears on a logarithmic 
  scale and the button label changes to &quot;Logarithmic intensity on&quot;. 
  The graphics window width is automatically modified to assure that maxima and 
  minima are plotted with a good resolution.</p>
<p>In the general case of <b>N&gt;2</b>, the intensity of the fringes becomes:</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec6.gif"> </p>

<p>This function has a series of main maxima for which the intensity is maximum, 
  separated the same distance &#916;x as before. Every two main maxima there are 
  N-2 secondary maxima and N-1 minima, of null intensity, having a separation:</p>
    
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec7.gif"> </p>
  
<p>All these general formulae reduce to the formula for the &quot;double slit&quot;case 
  when N is replaced by 2.</p>
  
<h2 class="h2joc">"Spatial coherence&quot; window</h2>

<p>In this window you can see the dependence of the visibility of the interference 
  fringes for Young's experiment (double slit case) on the characteristics of 
  the light source , in order to study the spatial coherence phenomenon. The visibility 
  factor is defined as: </p>
  
<p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec8.gif"> </p>
  
<p>where I<sub>M</sub> and I<sub>m</sub> is the fringe maximum and minimum intensity, 
  respectively.</p>
<p>In the &quot;plane wave&quot; window, slits were illuminated by a plane wave. 
  Now, there are several options for the light source:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>One point source</b> located a certain distance x<sub>0</sub> away from 
    the slits (x=0): this corresponds to the previous case but now the path length 
    difference has an additional term: 
    <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec9.gif"> </p>
    <p>where a is the distance between the plane of the source and the slits' 
      plane. Therefore, the fringes are not centered at x=<sub>0</sub>, but at:</p>
    <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec10.gif"></p>
    <p>for which the path length difference vanishes. If the source is placed 
      above the center, the fringes are displaced to the opposite side, downwards 
      (to the right of the plot). In any case, the visibility is V=1 as I<sub>m</sub>=0.</p>
  
  <li><b>Two point sources</b> separated a certain distance x<sub>0</sub>: the 
    resulting intensity is the sum of the contribution of each source, which give 
    fringes centered at different points:</li>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec11.gif"> </p>
  <p>This gives place to a fringe structure having the same fringe spacing as 
    in the case of a single source, but having a poorer contrast. The visibility 
    factor is:</p>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec12.gif"> </p>
  <li><b>A single extended source</b>: the intensity distribution can be found 
    by superposing (integrating) the resulting fringes along the entire source 
    extension &#916;S:</li>
  <p align="center"> <img src="formules/Young_Ec13.gif"> </p>
  <p>As before, the fringe spacing remains the same, whereas the fringe visibility 
    becomes:</p>
