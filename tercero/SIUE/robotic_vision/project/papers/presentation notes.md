**Updated Presentation Notes on Exoplanets**

1. **Introduction**
   - The night sky is filled with thousands of stars, many of which are too faint to see with the naked eye.
   - The question arises: Are there planets circling those stars, too? And are any of them like Earth?

2. **Planets in Our Solar System**
   - Our Sun is orbited by a diverse array of planets — big, small, airless, rocky, gaseous, hot, cold, and more.
   - This diversity suggests that forming planets might be a common occurrence.

3. **Methods of Detecting Exoplanets**
   - **Radial Velocity Method**: This method uses gravity to detect planets. A planet, although much smaller than the star, exerts a tiny gravitational pull on the star as it orbits. This causes the star to wobble back and forth. Astronomers use a spectrograph and powerful telescopes to examine the light coming from distant stars. The spectrograph splits the light from the star into its component colors, producing a spectrum. As the star moves closer to us, these lines shift towards the blue end of the spectrum, and as the star moves away, the lines shift towards the red end of the spectrum. Astronomers look for these back and forth motions of the lines in the star's spectrum to detect orbiting planets.
   - **Gravitational Microlensing**: In this method, scientists look for a small blip in the light coming from a distant star, caused by the warping of space in the presence of a planet. To see this blip, they need the light from the distant star to be magnified. This happens when a closer star passes in between us and the distant star. If the closer star has a planet orbiting it, then the planet's mass can add to the lens effect and increase the brightness of the distant star for a short time. When this happens, a blip can be seen in the brightness of the distant star. This method allows us to find exoplanets that are far from their star, and also allows us to find small exoplanets and potentially exo-moons - moons orbiting exoplanets.
   - **Transit Method**: Some planetary systems are aligned just so, such that the planet goes in front of the star, as seen from our telescope. Astronomers can monitor the brightness of the star and look for a tiny drop in brightness that might mean a planet is going in front of the star. The bigger the planet, the bigger the drop in brightness. And with those elements, astronomers can finally calculate the density of the planet.
   - **Direct Imaging**: This technique involves taking a picture of an exoplanet. It requires blocking out the star’s overwhelming glare with a device called a coronograph. This view is only possible because the planets are really huge, really far from their star, and they’re all glowing red hot. To improve direct imaging, we have to go to space to get above the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere. One proposed device to aid in this is the Starshade, a spacefaring parasol kind of like a free-floating coronagraph. The Starshade and telescope will line up perfectly like in a very straight line together with the target star.

4. **Discovery of Exoplanets**
   - The first true alien planets were found in 1992, orbiting a pulsar.
   - In 1995, a planet was found orbiting a star very much like the Sun, 51 Peg, using the Doppler shift method.

5. **Characteristics of Exoplanets**
   - The discovered exoplanets are diverse, ranging from "hot Jupiters" to planets smaller than Mercury.
   - Some exoplanets have been found to orbit binary stars, and planets may outnumber stars in the sky.

6. **Habitable Exoplanets**
   - While many Earth-sized planets have been found, whether they are Earth-like is still uncertain.
   - Factors such as the presence of an atmosphere, magnetic fields, and liquid water are unknown.
   - However, it is estimated that there may be more than 10 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Planets orbiting other stars exist and can be detected with a variety of methods.
   - Exoplanets appear to orbit nearly every kind of star, and we've even found planets that are the same size as Earth.
   - We think there may be many billions of Earth-like planets in our galaxy.
